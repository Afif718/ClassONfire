      <p>Before coronavirus, online classes were for students who work a full-time job or for people who cannot travel long distances to attend class. Now because of the pandemic, students from elementary school, middle school, high school and university are attending online classes. We don't know when this pandemic will end so the online classes might go on for a long time.</p>
        <br>

    <p style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Online Classes:</p>

      <p>For instance, it has been defined by Jama, et al., as a type of system of learning which is utilizing electronic technologies to access educational curriculum outside traditional classrooms [6]. Najran university-college of nursing surveyed 40 males and 40 females who were undergoing E-learning styles. To make the two groups as comparable as conceivable, the course instructional goals, substance, tasks and evaluations in the two segments were the equivalent that planned and actualized by the course coordinator. The two gatherings have a similar opportunity to speak with the course organizer for any requests varying.</p>

      <br>
      <br>

    <p>Two instruments were utilized for information assortment; first was the records of understudies acquired scores of the last test on the course of psychosocial social varieties of wellbeing close to a structured questionnaire. A last hypothetical test was planned and executed by the course facilitator as MCQs test which adjusted electronically for the two segments for deciding the students learning performance. Test organization took 2 hours and the greatest grade was 60 marks. The subsequent instrument was a self-directed and organized survey that used for contemplating the students' perspectives towards E-adapting other than their demographic information</p>

      <br>
      <br>

      <p>The gathered information was entered and examined by utilizing SPSS rendition 21.0 measurable software. The chances proportion (OR) with their certainty level (CI) were determined. Graphic insights of consistent factors were communicated as Mean ± Standard Deviation (± SD), p ≤ 0.05 was considered as measurably critical.</p>

     <br>

    <p>As shows up in Table 1, the consequences of the poll demonstrated the mean of the understudies' general fulfilment with the conventional face-to-face addresses in the benchmark group was 6.26, while the mean of the understudies' general fulfilment with E-learning among the Experimental group was 8.74. This closed outcome demonstrated that students were profoundly happy with E-learning since it upgraded their learning results.</p>

      <br>
      <br>

    <p>The current study was carried out in Najran university-college of nursing to show the impact of E-learning on academic performance in terms of the improved learning process, attitudes towards academic learning and its effects on academic performance. Numerous studies reported that students in higher educational institutions who engaged in E-learning generally performed better than those in face-to-face courses. They believed that E-learning is offering precious opportunities for higher education institutions [7-10].</p>

    <p>As many universities started to take online classes, Muhammad et al., wanted to see the students’ opinion of online classes. The survey was done in Lahore, Pakistan, they gave a set of questionnaire to Business Studies students from private and public universities. The sample consisted of  440  students  (219  female and  221  male),  selected by convenient sampling technique. The 216 respondents belonged to public universities and 224 were from private universities. [11] </p>

      <br>

    <p>The questionnaire had three parts, first parts had the demographical questions, the second part asked about students' opinion on online classes and lastly third part asked about students' opinion about on-campus classes. They got 216 response from public universities and 224 from private universities. They also did a pilot study with 30 participants, the result was 0.821, which is admissible. The questionnaire had 60 questions with 5 point Likert scale. Here are the results: </p>

     <br>
     <br>

    <p>The calculation was done using SPSS version 23, as you can see from Table 1, all the data were gathered and analyzed by using descriptive method i.e. mean and standard deviation and inferential statistics. The factor communication (M = 3.6114; SD = .76873) has a greater mean compared to mean and standard deviation of other factors of online classes. Contrariwise, from the table, you can see the students like on-campus better. There's a major difference in conceptual clarity of on-campus classes (M = 4.0077; SD = .48769) and conceptual clarity of online classes (M = 3.4927; SD = .73552). [12]</p>

     <br>
     <br>

        <p><b>In conclusion</b> students like on-campus classes better compared to online classes. Many students live in areas where there is no proper internet connection, they also do not have the latest technological devices. As the students do not have a laptop or smartphone, they have a communication barrier which leads to problems in conceptual clarity. [13] 
Students prefer on-campus classes because they get to go outside now due to the pandemic they’re bound to stay at home and attend online classes. [14]
